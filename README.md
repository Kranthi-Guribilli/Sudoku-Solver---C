# Sudoku Solver:
# About:
* A partially filled 9*9 2D array 'grid[9][9]' will be given, the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3 *3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.<br>


# Implementation
* <b>Approach-1: | [CODE SNIPPET](https://github.com/Kranthi-Guribilli/Sudoku-Solver-C/blob/main/Sudoku|Approach1.c)</b>
  <i>
  * The naive approach is to generate all possible configurations of numbers from 1 to 9 to fill the empty cells.
  * Try every configuration one by one until the correct configuration is found, i.e. for every unassigned position fill the position with a number from 1 to 9.
  * After filling all the unassigned position check if the matrix is safe or not. If safe print else recurs for other cases.</i>
  
* <b>Approach-2: | Backtracking | CODE SNIPPET([C](https://github.com/Kranthi-Guribilli/Sudoku-Solver-C/blob/main/Sudoku|Backtracking.c)</b>|[C++](https://github.com/Kranthi-Guribilli/Sudoku-Solver-C/blob/main/Sudoku|Backtracking.cpp))
  <i>
  * Sudoku can be solved by one by one assigning numbers to empty cells. Before assigning a number, check whether it is safe to assign.
  * Check that the same number is not present in the current row, current column and current 3X3 subgrid.
  * After checking for safety, assign the number, and recursively check whether this assignment leads to a solution or not.
  * If the assignment doesnâ€™t lead to a solution, then try the next number for the current empty cell.
  * And if none of the number (1 to 9) leads to a solution, return false and print no solution exists.</i>
